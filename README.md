# 🧠 Task-03: Decision Tree Classifier - Bank Marketing Dataset

🔍 **Internship Task**  
As part of my Data Science Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, I built a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and behavioral features.

## 📌 Project Objective

To explore the **Bank Marketing Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and:

- Preprocess and encode data
- Train a **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Evaluate prediction performance
- Visualize the decision process and feature importance

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn & matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the ZIP  
2. Place the `bank-full.csv` dataset in the `data/` folder  
3. Open the Python script in `notebooks/decision_tree_classifier.py`  
4. Run the code to see model training, evaluation, and visualizations

```bash
python decision_tree_classifier.py
